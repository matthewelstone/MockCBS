[View the live project here](https://matthewelstone.github.io/MockCBS/)

<img src="assets/images/readmeimages/amiresponsive.png">

This website was created for my Milestone Two Interactive Frontend Development Project. I wanted to make a mock exam site for the Cicerone Certified Beer Server exam. The user will have half an hour to answer sixty multiple choice questions with a passing mark of 45/60 just as in the actual exam.
